First of all, [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) must be installed in your system. 
If you have never installed *node.js* I recommend you to install it using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (Node Version Manager).

Once you have *node.js* installed you can install *yo* and the *generator*:

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-android-clean-architecture

mkdir MyAwesomeAndroidApp && cd MyAwesomeAndroidApp
yo android-clean-architecture
